From the Halls of Montezuma
To the shores of Tripoli;
We fight our country's battles
In the air, on land, and sea;
First to fight for right and freedom
And to keep our honor clean;
We are proud to claim the title
Of United States Marine.

Our flag's unfurled to every breeze
From dawn to setting sun;
We have fought in every clime and place
Where we could take a gun;
In the snow of far-off Northern lands
And in sunny tropic scenes,
You will find us always on the job
The United States Marines.

Here's health to you and to our Corps
Which we are proud to serve;
In many a strife we've fought for life
And never lost our nerve.
If the Army and the Navy
Ever look on Heaven's scenes,
They will find the streets are guarded
By United States Marines.",,status,,2015-07-17 08:16:14,16357,608,2124

Based on what we know thus far, I believe that this deal undermines our national security. President Obama has consistently negotiated from a position of weakness, giving concession after concession to a regime that has American blood on its hands, holds Americans hostage, and has consistently violated every agreement it ever signed. 

I expect that a significant majority in Congress will share my skepticism of this agreement and vote it down. Failure by the President to obtain congressional support will tell the Iranians and the world that this is Barack Obama’s deal, not an agreement with lasting support from the United States. 

It will then be left to the next President to return us to a position of American strength and re-impose sanctions on this despicable regime until it is truly willing to abandon its nuclear ambitions and is no longer a threat to international security.",,status,,2015-07-14 08:24:46,11830,897,1654

58736997707_10152794746422708,"Helping The Homeless Overcome And Achieve
By Jeanette Rubio

Last week, Marco and I attended an event honoring the work of Lotus House Women's Shelter, which serves homeless women in the heart of Miami's Overtown district.

This shelter was established by the Sundari Foundation, a non-denominational, non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of poor, disadvantaged and homeless women, youth and children by ensuring that they have the sanctuary, support, education and resources needed to heal, overcome adversity and realize their full potential.

I first learned of this project about 3 years ago through my work for the Braman Family Foundation. And earlier this year, I joined Florida First Lady Ann Scott in touring the Lotus House facilities and seeing firsthand the important work they're doing in providing services that range from medical care to parenting skills training to job readiness training, among others.

At this time, Lotus House is serving over 110 women and children in their shelter, with close to 300 being helped annually. Their work demonstrates not only some of the best practices other organizations committed to helping the homeless can learn from, but more importantly, it shows what extraordinary things people can do when they have the support and opportunity to achieve greater self-sufficiency and realize their dreams.

Each year, Lotus House honors one of its great success stories with its Star Recipient Award, which Marco had the honor of presenting to Mindy Jean-Pierre Etienne.

In introducing Mindy, he discussed how, at the age of 18, this Florida native had experienced personal and family challenges, faced an uncertain life, and had nowhere to go. With Lotus House's help, she continued going to school and eventually earned her diploma from Miami Edison Senior High School. Shortly thereafter, she enlisted in the U.S. Army and now serves on active duty in Ft. Bragg, N.C., where she lives with her husband, her high school sweetheart. In sum, she's living her American Dream.

Mindy reminds us all of how all people have great potential, even if, at times, that potential seems buried under a mountain of hardship. Her example also reminds us that every day, there are individuals and organizations of all stripes helping people to rise above their circumstances to achieve great things. We are thankful to all these heroes for their work and example.",Photos from Marco Rubio's post,photo,https://www.facebook.com/MarcoRubio/photos/a.274031027707.143644.58736997707/10152794707167708/?type=3,2014-11-10 20:00:01,4511,91,147

By Senator Marco Rubio

As our nation pauses to recognize Veterans Day, my wife Jeanette and I stand with all Americans in honoring those who have served in our armed forces. To the more than 20 million veterans living in the United States today, including the 1.6 million in Florida alone, we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude. It is because of the strength and valor of these men and women that the American people enjoy rights that have been so rare throughout the history of mankind, including the freedom to live our lives under the light of liberty, in a peaceful homeland, unbound by fear of oppression. 

Throughout our history, America’s veterans have met and defeated countless forces that have wished us ill, allowing our freedom to grow, prosper and spread as a model for the world. But as we reflect on the legacy of our veterans, we are also reminded of the families that have sacrificed greatly to ensure that their achievements were possible. The strength and support of our military families is a vital part of our national defense, and we proudly honor these families today.

Veterans Day also allows us an opportunity to reflect on the sacrifices of the Armed Service members currently serving at home and abroad. These men and women face enemies that are filled with disdain for our nation's guiding principles, yet each night we are able to put our children to bed with the knowledge that we are secure and safe, guarded by Americans of the highest honor and the greatest courage. We thank these men and women for their service, and we pray for the success of their mission and safe return home.

Americans in uniform have always stood as a paragon of selflessness, courage and devotion, and as such are an extraordinary example to their countrymen. So on this Veteran's Day, I encourage all Americans to join together in wishing our veterans, active service members and their friends and family a peaceful, meaningful Veterans Day. May God bless all of our veterans, and may God bless America.",,status,,2012-11-11 19:11:16,12075,801,584

58736997707_10151158214857708,"Today's Vote On Foreign Aid
By Marco Rubio 

In every region of the world, the United States should search for ways to use foreign aid and humanitarian assistance to strengthen our influence, the effectiveness of our leadership, and the service of our national interests and ideals.  When done effectively, in partnership with the private sector, with faith-based organizations, and our allies, foreign aid is a cost-effective way, not only to export our values and our example, but to advance our security and economic goals.

Foreign aid is a foreign policy tool used by the United States to work with other countries.  In the case of Libya, Egypt and Pakistan, each receives significant amounts of foreign aid from the U.S. taxpayers, and U.S. citizens expect these countries to meet the conditions we set upon this aid.  In the wake of the uprisings across the Muslim world, and the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, it is imperative that the U.S. receive the full cooperation of the host nations in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for the attacks on our diplomatic missions and the deaths of four brave Americans.

Senator Rand Paul’s legislation would affect aid for these countries by effectively eliminating it.  The American people deserve to be outraged following these attacks.  However, the situations in these three countries are very different.  In Egypt, the government has the security capabilities to protect our embassy and failed to do so.  It was unacceptable that their president didn’t immediately condemn the attacks and instead focused on a YouTube video.  

In Libya, there was a terrorist attack on our consulate which resulted in the death of four Americans, including the ambassador.  The Libyan people rejected Islamists in their recent election, but their pro-Western Libyan government does not have the security capabilities of the Egyptians.  So far, the Libyans are trying to do the right thing by working with the U.S. to investigate these attacks and strengthen their own security capabilities.  In fact, just yesterday thousands of Libyans fed up with terrorism took matters into their own hands by seizing control of the headquarters of several militias and demanding they be disarmed. Cutting off aid to Libya, who is trying to help us, is not the answer as it would weaken their ability to help us and undermine their efforts to defeat the terrorists in their country.  It would also represent America's stunning rejection of what is clearly the Libyan people's will to reject extremists and terrorists trying to lead Libya back to darkness.

With Pakistan, I believe we should condition some if not all of the aid on the release of Dr. Afridi. He has been arrested on false charges.  The time has finally come for Pakistan to decide if they are going to be a truthful ally of the U.S. 

Sen. Paul’s legislation lumps in three different countries with three very different situations and I could not support such a measure as drafted.  Prior to the vote on this matter I urged Senator Paul to consider, at a minimum, restructuring his amendment to recognize that there are considerable differences between Libya, Egypt and Pakistan.  Since no changes were ultimately made, I opposed this measure.",,status,,2012-09-22 11:23:23,3690,818,205

58736997707_10150360216327708,"The Washington Post on Friday accused me of seeking political advantage by embellishing the story of how my parents arrived in the United States.
 
That is an outrageous allegation that is not only incorrect, but an insult to the sacrifices my parents made to provide a better life for their children. They claim I did this because “being connected to the post-revolution exile community gives a politician cachet that could never be achieved by someone identified with the pre-Castro exodus, a group sometimes viewed with suspicion.”
 
If The Washington Post wants to criticize me for getting a few dates wrong, I accept that. But to call into question the central and defining event of my parents’ young lives – the fact that a brutal communist dictator took control of their homeland and they were never able to return – is something I will not tolerate.
 
My understanding of my parents’ journey has always been based on what they told me about events that took place more than 50 years ago — more than a decade before I was born. What they described was not a timeline, or specific dates.
 
They talked about their desire to find a better life, and the pain of being separated from the nation of their birth. What they described was the struggle they faced growing up, and their obsession with giving their children the chance to do the things they never could.
 
But the Post story misses the point completely. The real essence of my family’s story is not about the date my parents first entered the United States. Or whether they travelled back and forth between the two nations. Or even the date they left Fidel Castro’s Cuba forever and permanently settled here.
 
The essence of my family story is why they came to America in the first place; and why they had to stay.
 
I now know that they entered the U.S. legally on an immigration visa in May of 1956. Not, as some have said before, as part of some special privilege reserved only for Cubans. They came because they wanted to achieve things they could not achieve in their native land.
 
And they stayed because, after January 1959, the Cuba they knew disappeared. They wanted to go back — and in fact they did. Like many Cubans, they initially held out hope that Castro’s revolution would bring about positive change. So after 1959, they traveled back several times — to assess the prospect of returning home.
 
In February 1961, my mother took my older siblings to Cuba with the intention of moving back. My father was wrapping up family matters in Miami and was set to join them.
 
But after just a few weeks, it became clear that the change happening in Cuba was not for the better. It was communism. So in late March 1961, just weeks before the Bay of Pigs invasion, my mother and siblings left Cuba and my family settled permanently in the United States.
 
Soon after, Castro officially declared Cuba a Marxist state. My family has never been able to return.
 
I am the son of immigrants and exiles, raised by people who know all too well that you can lose your country. By people who know firsthand that America is a very special place.
 
My father spent the last 50 years of his life separated from the nation of his birth. Separated from his two brothers, who died in Cuba in the 1980s. Unable to show us where he played baseball as a boy. Where he met my mother. Unable to visit his parents’ grave.
 
My mother has spent the last 50 years separated from her native land as well. Unable to take us to her family’s farm, to her schools or to the notary office where she married my father.
 
A few years ago, using Google Earth, I attempted to take my parents back to Cuba. We found the rooftop of the house where my father was born. What I wouldn’t give to visit these places where my story really began, before I was born.
 
One day, when Cuba is free, I will. But I wish I could have done it with my parents.
 
The Post story misses the entire point about my family and why their story is relevant. People didn’t vote for me because they thought my parents came in 1961, or 1956, or any other year.

58736997707_236134276445131,"Yesterday, the Washington Post wrote an outrageous story that unfairly questioned Marco’s character and diminished his parents' story as Cuban exiles.

The story was so questionable that it is already being scrutinized by other newspapers. The Miami Herald, for instance, questioned whether the Washington Post “embellished” facts to make for a juicier story.

The fact of the matter is that Marco’s parents, like millions of other Cuban exiles, settled in America because they refused to live under the rule of a communist dictatorship. Marco’s parents' story is no different than the story of millions of Americans who found freedom and opportunity here after losing their country.

Unfortunately, negative media stories like these are all too common for conservatives.

We hope you will help us in fighting back and setting the story straight.
