Eliminating the income tax on virtually all small businesses will create new opportunities and help job creators invest back in their communities.

OHIO ADDING TO STOCKPILE OF HEALTH CARE 
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT
Ohio Department of Health seeks to be ready to support possible local needs across the state

COLUMBUS – The Ohio Department of Health (ODH) is adding to its stockpile of health care personal protective equipment in order to support any requests that may come from frontline health care providers treating suspected or confirmed cases of Ebola virus infection. Ohio has no cases of Ebola, but ODH will be ready to support local health care providers if a case is confirmed.

With a team of health care workers treating a single Ebola patient using as many as 240 sets of personal protective equipment per day, hospitals can quickly use up whatever stores they may have. ODH is adding to its already large stockpile in order to support whatever requests for support may come from local hospitals.

The Ohio Department of Health currently owns a stockpile of approximately 102,122 face masks, 2,592 goggles, 1,600 shoe covers, 576 coveralls, 1,350 hoods, 105,300 gloves, 29,220 respirators, and 7,026 gowns. These figures increase daily; however, as new shipments arrive. ODH is requesting approval to use $300,000 in existing funds to acquire additional personal protective equipment. The request will be considered on Monday by the Controlling Board, a body comprised of bipartisan members of the General Assembly and an official from the Ohio Office of Budget and Management that meets every two weeks to help manage and approve the use of state funds. Hospitals also have their own stores and supply contracts to constantly replenish supplies while ODH has additional stores in regional warehouses.",Timeline Photos,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JohnKasich/photos/a.10150241036600933.328337.77590795932/10152312877050933/?type=3,2014-10-17 10:32:57,1314,167,299

I have been fully briefed on the federal, state and local activities that are underway and have directed state health officials to aggressively respond to the situation and provide local health officials every resource and support they need.  Every effort must be taken to identify those at risk, monitor their health and avoid further risk. 

Ohio has a sophisticated state and local public health network that has been preparing for this possibility for several months and those plans are now being activated.  The Department of Health’s epidemiologists are on-site in Summit County to support local efforts and are in ongoing communication with the CDC to make sure we have the most up-to-date information.

The risk to people who have had no direct contact with the nurse remains very low, but everyone is seeking to apply the lessons from Dallas and we are responding aggressively to this situation, with a priority on public communication that is open, timely and accurate.  We will continue to provide as much information as soon as possible and provide local health care providers the resources they need to keep Ohioans safe.",Mobile Uploads,photo,https://www.facebook.com/JohnKasich/photos/a.10151665691615933.1073741825.77590795932/10152310039645933/?type=3,2014-10-15 14:26:43,2348,384,772
