""Hey, New Hampshire friend/long-lost cousin/college roommate I haven’t spoken to in forever—

I know you’re planning to vote tomorrow, right?!

And if you’re still making up your mind about who to vote for, I hope you’ll check out Hillary Clinton’s positions and see where she stands. I know you’ve always been concerned about college affordability—did you know Hillary has a smart, detailed plan for that? It’s one of the reasons I’m working so hard to elect her. You can check it out at hillaryclinton.com.

No matter who you vote for, make sure you vote! You can find your polling place here.

""Iowa friends, this message is for you!

Lots of people ask me why I’m working so hard to elect Hillary Clinton our next president (and the first female president of the United States). And I tell them it’s for people like my mom, who was a teacher in St. Louis for 36 years. I was raised by strong women, and Hillary reminds me of my mom—they’re both fighters. And please believe me when I say there is no one who fights harder for American families than Hillary.

And if you want someone who’s going to stand up to Republicans to defend the progress that we’ve made under President Obama—and who’s gonna fight for people like my mom and yours—then I’m asking you to caucus for Hillary on Monday night. Let’s do this!

One by one, each held up a picture of a beloved child killed by gun violence or by the police. They're not looking for sympathy, they just want to spare other families from what they've endured. And they're turning their grief into a powerful call of action for the nation.

One of those women is named Sybrina Fulton. Her son was Trayvon Martin. When he was killed, she found herself thrust into the national spotlight. I've gotten to know her, and she's a private person. She really didn't want to be a spokesperson for victims of gun violence and their families. She struggled with that for a long time, but after a lot of prayers, she decided she had to act. She said, ‘I have to do my part. I have to do something to remember my son. I have to do something to try to make a difference in this world. If you want change, it starts with you.’

And so on this Martin Luther King Day, as we remember this giant from our history, let us also think of Sybrina Fulton and everyone who gets up every morning, and takes a very deep breath, and gets to work trying to make a difference in our country and the world.

And I’ll tell you something else: We need to get rid of private prisons and detention centers. The power to keep people locked up should not be in the hands of unaccountable corporations. … I also want us to eliminate finally the disparity in sentencing between crack and cocaine.

People should not have to be afraid to go to college, like this one, or go to the movie theater, or go to bible study. What is wrong with us that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby and the gun manufacturers they represent? 

You know, this is not just tragic. We don't just need to pray for people. We need to act. And we need to build a movement. It's infuriating. Every time there's another massacre Republicans and the NRA say, now is not the time to talk about guns. Yes, it is. But more than talk, it is time to act.

But Republicans keep refusing to do anything to protect our communities. They put the NRA ahead of American families. It is wrong and we need to make every politician who sides with them to look into the eyes of parents whose children have been murdered and explain why they listen to the gun lobbyist instead.

Now, I am well aware that this is a political mountain to climb. But you don't get anything done in this country if you don't start by calling it out. And we have had too many murders, too many people who should have never gotten guns in the first place taking out whatever their rage, their fury, their mental problems are by killing other people.

It's bad enough to see hateful rhetoric and lies in a presidential debate. But just like the candidates on stage last night, Republicans in Congress want to defund Planned Parenthood. And they’re willing to shut down the federal government to do it, no matter how bad that is for our country. That’s how far they’ll go to stop an organization that provides 500,000 breast exams, 400,000 pap tests, and 4.5 million STD tests every year. 
 
Repeating false statements doesn't make them true, no matter how many times you do it. Defunding a trusted health care provider that serves one in five women in America doesn't help anyone – in fact, it would hurt hundreds of thousands of people. Speaker Boehner and his colleagues have a job to do, and they should do it. Here’s my message to them: Don’t attack women’s health care.

Yes, I should have used two email addresses, one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department. Not doing so was a mistake. I'm sorry about it, and I take full responsibility.

It's important for you to know a few key facts. My use of a personal email account was aboveboard and allowed under the State Department's rules. Everyone I communicated with in government was aware of it. And nothing I ever sent or received was marked classified at the time. 

As this process proceeds, I want to be as transparent as possible. That's why I've provided all of my work emails to the government to be released to the public, and why I'll be testifying in public in front of the Benghazi Committee later next month.

I know this is a complex story. I could have—and should have—done a better job answering questions earlier. I'm grateful for your support, and I'm not taking anything for granted.

So, here's a new plan: We're going to create a scholarship program for student parents, called SPARK—Student Parents in America Raising Kids. It will give extra financial help for student parents who keep their grades up. It's not a lot of money, but it's enough to help pay for gas or a babysitter—just the kind of extra help that can keep somebody in school. 

We're also going to significantly increase access to quality childcare on college campuses. Childcare centers already exist on some campuses, but a lot of parents don't have any safe, affordable place to leave their kids while they go to school. 

The financial benefits of all this are clear: Students with college degrees can earn more than a half a million dollars over their lifetimes more than students with high school degrees. When a parent is able to get that education that so many parents work for, it really makes a difference. This is going to be good for kids, for students, and for parents.

889307941125736_961889437200919,"What Donald Trump said about Megyn Kelly after the first Republican debate was offensive, and it deserves the kind of reaction that it's getting from so many others—but if we focus on that, we're making a mistake. What a lot of the men on that stage in the debate said was offensive: some very radical and offensive positions when it comes to women's lives, women's reproductive health, women's opportunities. 
 
When one of the GOP’s major candidates, Marco Rubio, says there should be no exceptions for rape and incest in a ban on abortion, that is as offensive and as troubling a comment as you can hear from a major candidate running for the presidency. The language may be more colorful and more offensive when it comes from one candidate, but the thinking, and the attitude, toward women is very much the same as the rest—it's just delivered in a different package. What they say about women should not be forgotten. 

So yes, it makes great TV. Trump went way overboard: offensive, outrageous, pick your adjective. But what Rubio said has as much of an impact in terms of where the Republican party is today as anybody else on that stage. And it is deeply troubling, and it should be to the press, not just to those who fight for women’s health and rights.",,status,,2015-08-14 12:15:51,21118,2703,2184
